# py_projects
I will include some projects in this repo to keep coding. 

-> First, here it is a word-guessing game.
In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which our interpreter will choose a random word. 
The user first has to input their names and then, be asked to guess any alphabet. 
If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement)
else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet. The user will
be given 3 turns(which can be changed accordingly) to guess the complete word.

-> Second, build a number guessing game, in which the user selects a range. Let’s say the user selected a range, 
i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
The system will select some random integer and the user has to guess that 
integer in the minimum number of guesses.

-> Third, we want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. 
We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). 
Return True if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. 
This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops.
